## **Day 1: Laying the Foundation**  
**Objective:** Establish the core structure of the **Furniwise** marketplace by selecting an optimal business model.  

**Key Activities:**  
- Evaluated **e-commerce vs. q-commerce** models to define project scope.  
- Finalized **Next.js** as the core framework for the project.  
- Established a **GitHub repository** with a well-structured folder hierarchy.  
- Created initial project files, including `package.json`, `.gitignore`, and `README.md`.  

**Outcome:** A solid **technical foundation** was established, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

## **Day 2: Technical Documentation & Planning**  
**Objective:** Define the project's **technical architecture, database schema, and API strategy**.  

**Key Activities:**  
- Designed the **database schema** and outlined entity relationships.  
- Created API documentation detailing endpoints, parameters, and expected responses.  
- Established an **authentication system** using JWT for secure user access.  
- Planned the **backend infrastructure**, focusing on Sanity CMS integration.  

**Outcome:** A well-documented **technical blueprint** for efficient development.

## **Day 3: API Integration & Data Migration**  
**Objective:** Connect the backend with external APIs and migrate data to **Sanity CMS**.  

**Key Activities:**  
- Integrated **third-party APIs** for product listings and order management.  
- Implemented **data migration scripts** to transfer existing records into **Sanity CMS**.  
- Validated API responses using **Postman** and tested real-time data flow.  
- Implemented error handling strategies for failed API calls.  

**Outcome:** A fully functional **API-driven backend** integrated with external services.

## **Day 4: Building Dynamic Frontend Components**  
**Objective:** Develop **interactive UI components** to enhance user experience.  

**Key Activities:**  
- Designed **dynamic product listing pages** using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.  
- Implemented **state management** for smooth user interactions.  
- Integrated **real-time search and filtering** functionality.  
- Optimized page rendering using **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)**.  

**Outcome:** A visually appealing, highly interactive **frontend experience**.

## **Day 5: Testing, Error Handling & Backend Integration**  
**Objective:** Conduct **comprehensive testing** to ensure platform reliability.  

**Key Activities:**  
- **Functional Testing:** Verified key workflows such as cart operations, product searches, and user authentication.  
- **Performance Testing:** Used **Lighthouse** and **GTmetrix** to analyze speed and responsiveness.  
- **Security Testing:** Ensured API security, validated input fields, and enforced **HTTPS**.  
- **Backend Refinement:** Optimized database queries and improved **error-handling mechanisms**.  
- **Test Case Documentation:** Logged successful and failed test cases in a structured **CSV file**.  

**Outcome:** A thoroughly tested platform ready for **staging deployment**.

## **Day 6: Deployment Preparation & Staging Environment Setup**  
**Objective:** Deploy the marketplace to a **staging environment** and ensure production readiness.  

**Key Activities:**  
- **Hosting Platform:** Selected **Vercel** for deployment and connected the GitHub repository.  
- **Environment Variables:** Secured API keys and database credentials using `.env`.  
- **Staging Deployment:** Deployed the application and validated successful builds.  
- **Final Testing:** Conducted additional **performance, security, and functional tests**.  
- **Documentation Updates:** Compiled **test reports, API documentation, and deployment instructions**.  

**Outcome:** A fully operational **staging environment** ready for final review and live deployment.
